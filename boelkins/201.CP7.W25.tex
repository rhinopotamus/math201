{\bf Checkpoint 7}
\end{center}


\noindent {\bf Directions:}

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {\bf Desmos.} We will often use \emph{Desmos} for computations and graphing, just like we do during class.  Any work done in \emph{Desmos} must be summarized and briefly explained in writing on your paper.  
	
	\item {\bf Resources.} During each checkpoint, you may access your 1 page of notes, \emph{Desmos}, and our Blackboard page (for submission); no other uses of your computer or tablet are permitted.  No collaboration with other human beings or use of other internet resources are allowed.
	
	\item {\bf Competency.} Each week, your goal is to demonstrate competency on as many of the included learning targets as you can.  Each question will be marked either ``Y'' or ``NY'': Y for ``yes!'', NY for ``not yet''.  Every learning target will appear on three consecutive checkpoints, so you'll have multiple attempts to demonstrate competency.  ``Competency'' is defined as work that demonstrates clear and complete understanding of the relevant concepts in the learning target. While the work may include a minor error, or one or two minor steps may not be well explained, otherwise the work is complete, correct, and convincing, including the proper use of notation, and appropriate explanation of meaning that uses correct terminology.  (On rare occasions, you might get a ``NY*''; such a mark means you are close to competency and that you have the option to have a short conversation with me prior to the next Checkpoint and attempt to demonstrate competency through the conversation aloud.)	
	
	\item {\bf Submission.}  When finished, use a scanning app to create digital images of your work and upload it to Blackboard under the current Checkpoint location, doing so by 1 pm.
	
\end{itemize}

\noindent \hrulefill \\

\noindent {\bf Learning Targets:} For Checkpoint \#7, there are four learning target being assessed: 

\begin{quote}
{\bf LT 6}: I can recognize and explain the relationships among the behaviors of $f$, $f'$, and $f''$ by analyzing graphical or numerical information from one or more of $f$, $f'$, and $f''$. (Section 1.6)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{\bf LT 7}: I can find an equation of the tangent line to a function at a point and use the tangent line to approximate values of the function. (Section 1.8)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{\bf LT 8}:  I can use the product and quotient rules to find the derivative of a function. (Section 2.3)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{\bf LT 9}: I can use the chain rule to find the derivative of a composite function. (Section 2.5) 
\end{quote}

%\noindent Name: \\ 

\noindent To demonstrate competency on Learning Target \#$n$, you need to correctly respond to all or nearly all of the prompts in question \#$n$.  If you have already passed a learning target on a prior Checkpoint, you don't need to re-attempt it on this one.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
		\item[6.] 	
		\be
			
			\item On the axes provided, sketch a possible graph of a function $y = g(x)$ that has the following properties: $g(-1) = 2$, $g'(-1) = -\frac{1}{2}$, $g'(x)$ is always negative (that is, for all values of $x$), and $g''(x)$ is positive for $x < -1$ and $g''(x)$ is negative for $x > -1$.  Write a careful sentence to explain why you drew your graph as you did.

			\item The value of a car, $V(m)$ (in dollars), depends on the number of miles, $m$, the car has been driven.  Say we know that $V(25000) = 23525$, $V'(25000) = -1.23$, and $V''(25000) = 0.017$. In everyday language, explain what we know about the behavior of the car's value at the moment when the car has been driven 25000 miles.  Cite all three pieces of given information, with units.
			
			\lr \tr

		\ee

\pagebreak
	
	\item[7.] For a given function $y = F(x)$, say that we know the following information:  $F(-1) = -5$ and $F'(x)$ is given by the formula $F'(x) = 1-\frac{7}{4}x^4$.  \\ 
	
	\emph{Again, the formula given is $F'(x)$, the derivative of $F(x)$.}
	
	Throughout the following questions, proper and correct notation is essential.
	
	\be
		\item Find a formula for $L(x)$, the tangent line approximation to $y = F(x)$, at the point $(a,F(a))$, where $a = -1$.
		
		\lr \tr \tr
		
		\item Use the tangent line approximation you found in (a) to estimate $F(-0.8)$.  Clearly show your work using proper notation.
		
		\lr \tr \tr
		
		\item Is the estimate you found in (b) too large or too small?  Why?
		
		\tr
	\ee

	\item[8.] Consider two function $f$ and $g$ for which the following values are given: 
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 	$x$ & $f(x)$ & $f'(x)$ & $g(x)$ & $g'(x)$ \\ \hline
	3 & 7 & 3/4 & -4 & -1/3 \\ \hline
	-2 & 5 & -3 & 2 & 2/5 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	
	(In the table, note that the $x$ values are at the far left, and then the column tells you the corresponding function/derivative value.  For example: $f'(3) = 3/4$.) 
	
	
	\be
		\item If $h(x) = g(x) \cdot f(x)$, determine $h'(3)$.  Cite any structure rules that you use and clearly show your work and thinking with proper notation.
		
		\lr \tr
		
		\item If $v(x) = \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}$, determine $v'(-2)$.  Cite any structure rules that you use and clearly show your work and thinking with proper notation.
		
		\lr \tr
		
	For the final part of this question, consider the two functions $r(t) = t^t$ and $s(t) = \arccos(t)$, whose derivatives are 
	$$r'(t) = t^t(\ln(t)+1) \ \mbox{and} \ s'(t) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}$$ (do not worry about where these derivative formulas for $r'$ and $s'$ come from). \\
		
		\item If $\displaystyle q(t) =  \frac{s(t)}{r(t)}$, determine a formula for $q'(t)$.   Cite any structure rules you use; use the given information above about $r$ and $s$, but {\bf do not simplify your result -- there is no algebra you need to do}.
	\ee

	\item[9.] Consider the two piecewise linear functions $p$ and $q$ given by the figure below.
	
\begin{center}  
\scalebox{0.35}{\includegraphics{images-W25/CP7-11-3LTs.png}} \\
\end{center}

Determine each of the following derivative values that involve functions that are defined in terms of $p$ and $q$.  Clearly show your work and thinking using proper notation, be sure your values are \emph{exact} in light of the given information, and write one sentence to explain your overall approach.

	\be
		\item Let $z(x) = q(p(x))$.  Determine $z'(1)$.
		
		\lr \tr
		
		\item Let $m(x) = q(x^3)$.  Determine $m'(-1)$.
		
		\lr \tr
		
		\item Let $n(x) = e^{p(x)}$.  Determine $n'(-2)$.
	\ee
