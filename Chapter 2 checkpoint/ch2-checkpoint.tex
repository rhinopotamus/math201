Before anything else, please do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rank your confidence from 0-5 on each of the learning targets. 5 means ``I could teach a whole class about this;'' 0 means ``I am genuinely not sure I have heard these words before.''
    \item Write your name on this page and on each of the other pages of the quiz.
\end{itemize}

Then do the quiz! Some reminders:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open notes, closed computer.
    \item If you need more room to write, use the back of the same learning target page, or ask me for some scratch paper.
    \item Read the questions carefully and make sure you're answering each part.
    \item Show all your work and explain all your thinking!
\end{itemize}

When you are done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rank your confidence from 0-5 on each of the learning targets. 5 means ``I absolutely nailed that question for sure;'' 0 means ``oof, I definitely didn't get that one.''
    \item Make double sure your name is on every page, including any scratch paper.
    \item Hand in your work, separated by learning target.
\end{itemize}

Have fun and do your best! I believe in u $\heartsuit$
