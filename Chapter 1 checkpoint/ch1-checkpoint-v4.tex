\section{Learning target DF1, version 3}

Below is a graph of the function $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{x^4}{12}-\frac{x^2}{2}-x$. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[domain=-4:4, xscale = 2, yscale = 1] 
%grid and axis: 
\draw[very thin, color=lightgray] (-3,-3) grid (4,4);
\draw[->] (-3.1, 0) -- (4.1, 0) node[right] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0, -3.1) -- (0, 4.1) node[above left] {$f(x) $};

%x-axis labels:
\foreach \i in {-3,-2,-1,1, 2, 3,4} {
	\draw (\i, .1) -- (\i, -.1) node[below] {\scriptsize \i};
}
%y-axis labels:
\foreach \i in {-3,-2,-1, 1, 2, 3, 4} {
	\draw (.1,\i) -- (-.1, \i) node[below left] {\scriptsize \i};
}
\draw[very thick, color=black, domain=-2.8:3.6, samples=100] plot (\x,{0.08333*\x*\x*\x*\x-0.5*\x*\x-\x}) node[] {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item On the graph above, draw the tangent line to the curve at $x=-1$. 

\item On the graph above, draw a secant line that goes through the curve at $x=-1$ and at some other nearby $x$-value of your choice.

\item Calculate the slope of that secant line.

\vfill

\item Use $f'(x)$ to calculate the slope of the tangent line. Compare the value you get here to the value you got in part (c). Does that make sense?

\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\section{Learning target DF2, version 3}

Suppose that  \(p(z) = -2 \, z^{3} +5 \, z^{2} - 4 \, z +4\). Use the limit definition of the derivative to find $p'(z)$.

\vspace{1em} 

Algebra hint: $(z+h)^3 = z^3 + 3z^2 h + 3z h^2 + h^3$.

\section{Learning target DFa, version 3}

Let $f(t)$ be the number of centimeters of rain that have fallen since midnight, where $t$ is the time in hours. What do each of the following mean? 

\textbf{Give units} to every number that you write down; \textbf{don't say ``per'' and don't say ``rate''.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% At 3am, 1.5cm of rain had fallen
\item $f(3) = 1.5$
\vfill
% At 3am, rain fell at a rate of 0.2 cm/hr
\item $f'(3) = 0.2$
\vfill
\item Would the statement $f'(5) = -0.7$ make sense?
Why or why not?
\vfill

\end{enumerate}

\section{Learning target DFb, version 4}

Here is the graph of some wacky function $q(t)$:

\begin{center}

\end{center}


Sketch the graph of $q'(t)$ on the blank axes below.

\section{Learning target AD2, version 4}

Part of the graph of this function $f(x)$ has been erased. 
We'll use linear approximation to recover the values.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../images/linapprox.png}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Draw the tangent line to this function at $x = 1$.
\item Suppose we know that $f'(1) = 0.65$. Use point-slope form to write down an equation for $L(x)$, the tangent line to this function at $x=1$.
\vfill
\item Use your equation for $L(x)$ to estimate $f(1.4)$.
\vfill
\item Do you think it is more likely that this is an 
overestimate or an underestimate? How come?
\vfill
\end{enumerate}
